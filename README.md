# Numbers
Its easy and fun, the game was built to inspire learning math.
The math problems will always be x + y and always <= 100.
You collect points by taping the right option. 
When you tap the right option you will get a point multiplied by the current combo you have going on, you will also be given extra time to continue playing. 
But be aware, the more points you have the faster time counts down.
